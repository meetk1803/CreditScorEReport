    <string name="t_ans">Ans:-CIBIL score or report plays a very important role in an individual’s financial life. So much so that lenders totally rely on the reports to assess the credit worthiness and as to how much credit they can give you. So it’s always better to be on the higher side of the credit score because there will be brighter chances of getting credit approvals or else they would not trust you with their lending. A higher score will also help in getting some of the best interest rates.</string>
    <string name="t_que">How does your CIBIL score/report matter?</string>
    <string name="tips_1_ans_1">A credit score is a measure of an individual\'s ability to pay back the borrowed amount. It is the numerical representation of their creditworthiness. A credit score is a 3 digit number that falls in the range of 300-900, 900 being the highest. You should always work towards reaching a credit score that is close to 900. A higher credit score offers you several benefits and helps you at the time of getting a loan or a credit card. Having a low credit score suggests you have not been a responsible borrower and have been slacking off repaying the borrowed sum. Credit scores are calculated by the credit bureaus in the country after taking into consideration several factors like the length of your credit history, repayment records, credit inquiries, among others. \10\10When you apply for a loan or a credit card, lenders like banks and non banking finance companies check your credit score to see whether you have the ability to repay the credit. If you have a higher credit score, you are entitled to receive preferential pricing and get discounts on the interest rate. Moreover, a high credit score gives your the additional power to negotiate for better rates of interest on loans. Steps To Get Your Free Credit Score</string>

    <string name="tips_2_ans_1">A credit score ranges between 300-900. The closer your credit score is to 900, higher the chances are for you to get a good deal for loan as well as credit card. Let\'s take a look at the different credit score range: \10 ➽ NA/NH : In order to calculate your credit score, you need to have a credit history. If you have no credit history, your credit report will mention that your credit score is NA/NH. \10 ➽ 300-550 :A credit score in this range is considered as a poor credit score. It suggests that you have defaulted your payments and have unpaid dues. \10 ➽ 550-650 : A credit score in this range is considered as average. You will still have to take measures to improve your credit score. \10 ➽ 650-750 : A credit score is this range is considered as good and lenders will consider granting you credit in the form of loan or credit card. However, you might still not be in the position to negotiate for a good deal. \10 ➽ 750-900 : With a credit score in this range, you will be less likely to turn as a defaulter and lenders will be willing to offer you with a great deal for loan as well as credit cards. A credit score in this range also gives you the additional power to negotiate for better deal in terms of credit card rewards and interest rates.</string>
    <string name="tips_2_ans_2">Your Credit Score is computed by Credit Information Companies. There are four companies in Indian which do the job - CIBIL TransUnion, Experian, Equifax and High Mark.Let\'s unveil the mystery around how these companies compute your score. When you make a transaction the one that is relevant to determine your score banks send details about it to all four credit bureaus. To send details to all credit agencies is a mandate by the RBI. Essentially, banks keep Credit Information Companies up-to-date about your monetary habits. If a bank needs to check your Credit Score, they can approach any one of the bureaus. It doesn\'t matter which one because all will have the same score for you all four are equally authoritative and on par with each other. After receiving information from the bank, credit bureaus get down to the task of collecting more information about your financial habits from other banks and financial institutions. The credit bureaus then processes this information to formulate what is called a Credit Report. \10Now, what is a Credit Report? A Credit Report is your financial marks card. It contains your Credit Score. It\'s wiser to check your score from time to time.</string>
    <string name="tips_2_ans_3">It is very important that you keep a close eye on your Credit Score. It is the best way to gauge your chances to get a line of credit. Another reason why you should track your score is to know if it dips, or if an error has been made by credit agencies while calculating your score. This will help you make timely amends.</string>
    <string name="tips_2_ans_4">Though the processes followed to compute your score might differ from agency to agency, your Credit Score calculated by all will be the same. This is because banks intimate the relevant information to all four agencies. Therefore, no matter which agency a bank picks to check your Credit Score, there will be no major discrepancy in it. \10Of the four agencies, CIBIL, however, is the most popular since it was one of the first Credit Information Companies to start operations in India. This has fuelled the notion that CIBIL Score is more accurate than a score from other agencies. This, however, is not true. Banks give equal weightage to scores from all four agencies. Equifax Experian and High Mark Credit Scores are as good to banks and other financial institutions as CIBIL Score. \10BankBazaar has tied up with Experian, which means that we can help you check your Credit Score for free. Otherwise, it costs a few hundred rupees.</string>
    <string name="tips_2_ans_5">Though many believe this, it\'s not true. \10All Credit Information Companies, including CIBIL, create your Credit Reports which tell banks about you credibility. Second, CIBIL and the other credit agencies do not entertain requests from individuals to make changes to financial details in Credit Reports. Changes are incorporated when banks provide relevant information to these agencies. This ensures that information in your Credit Report is legitimate. After all, your Credit Score is one of the most important factors considered by banks when deciding about your loan or Credit Card application. Your Credit Score also determines the interest rate banks chalk up for you. \10So make sure that you score big on this one!</string>

Let\'s not even imagine getting approval for a credit line. Hence, check your Credit Score before you apply for a financial product. Work up the score if it\'s not in the acceptable range. \10TIP: Credit agencies review and renew your score every few months. If you have a poor Credit Score, start managing your money wisely and pay your dues on time for a good few months. Credit agencies will reward you by boosting your score.</string>
    <string name="tips_3_ans_1">It depends on the kind of enquiry being made. There are two types of enquiries hard and soft enquiry. Hard enquiries send your Credit Score down by a few points, while soft enquiries do not impact your Credit Score. \10An enquiry made by an individual is called a soft enquiry.

You will know whether your score will tide you over or if it needs fixing. \10A hard enquiry is when a financial institution checks your Credit Score to take a decision on your credit application. Every time you apply for a loan or a Credit Card, the lending institution checks your score. Each time a bank checks your score, your score will dip by a few points. \10TIP: If you are applying for a loan or a Credit Card, do not apply to many banks at the same time. Too many enquiries will hurt your Credit Score.</string>
    <string name="tips_3_ans_2">It is understood that having high balances on your credit cards can significantly reduce your credit score. Apart from that, there are several other factors that can hurt your credit score: \10 ➽ Being late on your credit payments. \10 ➽ Completely ignoring your loan dues/credit card bills. \10 ➽ Creditors charge off accounts when credit card bills are not paid on time. The status of having your account charged off is one of the worst incidents that reflects on your credit score. \10 ➽ Lenders use third-party debt collectors to retrieve the loan amount from you, in case they do not receive payments. Having your account sent to collections reflects very poorly on your credit score. \10 ➽ Filing for bankruptcy can have a devastating effect on your credit score. \10 ➽ When you request to close a credit card that has an outstanding balance, your credit limit drops to Rs.0. This is similar to a situation where you have maxed out your credit card. \10 ➽ Closing old credit cards shortens your credit history. This has a negative impact on your credit score. \10 ➽ Applying for multiple credit cards or loans within a short duration makes your credit score plunge. Hence, it is advisable to limit the number of applications. \10 ➽ Having only one type of credit account will negatively impact your credit score. So, you should look to maintain a mix of loans and credit card debts and make consistent payments on time. \10 ➽ If you fail to check your credit report occasionally and fix errors, if any, your credit score can be hurt. It should be understood that credit reporting bureaus also make mistakes while creating credit reports. If you do not monitor and correct your report, it may cost you a lot in the future.</string>
    <string name="tips_3_ans_3">When you work on improving your credit, you should be very patient, so as to not get discouraged. Credit scores are calculated from your credit report. When you request for the score from multiple credit reporting bureaus, you may see a slight variance in the figures. This is fine, as long as the difference is not massive. \10In order to understand how your credit score changes over time, you should know how often there will be updates to your credit report. Lenders/creditors usually report your credit information (both positive and negative) to credit bureaus once a month. So, technically your credit scores can change a little each month, based on the information that is updated.</string>
    <string name="tips_3_ans_4">Most of the changes in your credit score happen incrementally. Although you would not see changes instantly, over a period of time this can add up to a considerable amount. \10However, there are certain factors that could instantly have a huge negative impact on your score. This includes a delinquency, i.e., a significantly late payment such as a 30-day delay on a credit. \10Another big influence is the credit utilisation ratio. This refers to the amount you owe as debt as opposed to your credit limit. So, an increase in credit card debt will cause your credit utilisation ratio to rise, which in turn drops your credit score. \10Consider another scenario in which you pay off all your credit card debts in one go. Your credit utilisation ratio will fall in this case. This would lead to a temporary hike in your credit score.</string>
    <string name="tips_3_ans_5">A bank or lender would check your credit score or report to review your credit management skills, based on the review, a lender may or may not give you a credit. It is advisable to keep an eye on the credit score before applying for a credit card or loan. If you have a poor credit score and you keep applying for credit, every reject will further lower your score. \10A good credit score will empower you with the ability to negotiate the interest rates. The banks or lender would like to offer a credit line to someone with a better credit score.</string>
    <string name="tips_4_ans_1">Credit bureaus in the country compute credit scores after considering several factors such as credit history and repayment behaviour. There are total of four credit bureaus in the country viz - TransUnion CIBIL, Experian, Equifax, and CRIF High Mark. All these credit bureaus are licenced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The financial institutions in the country send credit details of an individual on a monthly basis to credit bureaus. Each credit bureau has their own algorithm and method of calculating credit scores. Below are five factors that are taken into consideration at the time of calculating the credit score: \10 ➽ Credit History \10Credit history is one of the most important factors that affect your credit as it accounts for 35% of your total credit score. \10 ➽ Credit Utilization \10The credit usage is the second biggest factor that comprises your credit score. It accounts for 30% of your total credit score. \10 ➽ Age of the Credit \10The age of the credit accounts for 15% of your credit score. If you have handled your credit well and served the loan for a longer period by making timely payments, then it will positively affect your CIBIL score. \10 ➽ Mix Credit \10The types of credit present in your credit score accounts for 10% of your credit score. It is better to have a good balance of secured as well as unsecured loans in your credit history. A mix credit helps to boost your credit score. \10 ➽ Credit Inquiries \10Credit inquiries account for 10% of your credit score and therefore you should not apply for multiple credits at the same time.</string>
    <string name="tips_4_ans_2">The credit score is updated on a monthly basis based on the relevant information provided by financial institutions. It is advisable to keep an eye on the credit score to determine your financial credibility while applying for a loan or a credit card. It will help you in avoiding the situation where your credit application are getting rejected due to a poor score. By monitoring the score on a regular basis will help in identifying mistakes and correcting errors before they are too late.</string>
    <string name="tips_4_ans_3">When you are obtaining your credit score or report, it is considered to be a soft inquiry and it doesn\'t have any adverse impact on your score. When the bank or lender inquiries for a credit report, it is referred to as hard inquiry and it can reduce your score. You can be rest assured that your credit score won\'t get impacted due to soft inquiries. \10A credit score inquiry through BankBazaar would require furnishing PAN card details along with phone number.
